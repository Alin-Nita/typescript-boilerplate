# Typescript Example Project

## Testing ðŸ§ª

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (RTL), which both come out of the box with Create React App (CRA).

All component files should have an associated test file with it. It's really important to test components _in isolation_

### Snapshot Test

### Implementation Test
