# Typescript Example Project

## File Structure üóÇÔ∏è

Components contains all generic components that are shared across screens. They should be generic and reusable, and be testable in isolation.

Data contains everything to do with external requests, api calls. Everything that leaves our application should do so through our api.ts file.

[Enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html) contains enums! These help us keep control of 'magic values'. Things we need to access in a lot of different places and/ or may change in the future.

[Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html) contains both our **internal** and **server** interfaces. Internal interfaces are only used for items in our frontend, while server interfaces contain both **requests** (what we're going to send the backend) and **responses** (what we're going to receive from the backend).

Styles contains our global style files that should be made available across our whole application, and our individual component styles.

Utils are for handy functions that are available project-wide, these should have good descriptive names so other developers can quickly check whether the function they're looking for exists.

Views contains our different application views (pages/ screens). Generally any requests should be activated here so that any children components don't have to, e.g. If we have a 'User Details' view, we should dispatch our request to getUserDetails from here.

## Routing üõ£Ô∏è

This project uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing. All of our routing logic is inside our App.tsx file. To access parameters we can do useParams. In this example I am using an interface to type our incoming parameters:

```
interface UserViewParameters {
	userId: string;
}

let { userId } = useParams<UserViewParameters>();
```

## Testing üß™

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (RTL), which both come out of the box with Create React App (CRA).

All component files should have an associated test file with it. It's really important to test components _in isolation_.
